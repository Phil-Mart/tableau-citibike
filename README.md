Tableau HTML to explore Citibike data

This data set was collected from NYC's public API for their rideshare program, Citi Bike in the month of March of 2023.

From this data, we can quickly and dynamically discover rich insights from ridership patterns based on the day of the week, zip code, and rider type. 

Overall, one should be able to quickly deduce that member-riders dominate this program's ridership in Jersey City & Hoboken, while also realizing that there are a few key locations that lack access. 

Enjoy!
